Title: Developing a Dice Game with React and Styled Components

In my recent project, I created a dice game using React and utilized Styled Components for styling. Throughout the project, I learned how to implement routing, enabling different views, and tackled error messaging to provide a seamless user experience. This project enhanced my React skills while offering practical insights into managing state, UI styling, and handling errors in web applications.
